The last project I worked on involved bootstrapping and researching a crossplatform application that John Deere could use to quickly quote and invoice customers from a phone.  The application invloved scanning and parsing drivers licences as well as integrating with already existing sale center API's.  This is a proprietary unpublished project of John Deere.
